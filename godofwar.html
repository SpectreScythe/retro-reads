    <h1> INTRODUTION </h1>
    <p> Atreus only knows the world that he lives in with his dad. They've lived in this forest, a very small area.
      They're going out on the road together. Dad is just Dad. You don't really know any different. That's just a
      parameters for his life. As he starts to learn who he is, how he fits into all of this and who his dad is, it's an
      interesting sort of way that—he sees life differently than we see Kratos. He allows us to see Kratos with a
      slightly different lens because he's experiencing it all differently. </p>
