                All eyes will be on Indian captain Jasprit Bumrah as he leads a team of relative newcomers against Ireland in a 3-match T20I series, 
                starting Friday. Before the match, Bumrah addressed a press conference and shed light on his rehabilitation process and how he was feeling 
                on donning the national colours after so many months.“Everything is fine. Very happy to be back. Been working very hard at the NCA. It’s been 
                a long road and it feels very good, the body feels good and looking forward to playing some cricket.

              " I need more game time so I am looking forward to it,” Bumrah said when he was asked how he was feeling. Bumrah said, “I don’t take others’ opinions 
              seriously, even if it’s good or bad and even if I respect these opinions. "
